# CTMRG-by-ITensor

This the sorce code for CTMRG(Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalization Group) method.(https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9507087v5)
CTMRG is one of the DMRG method, and it calculate the thermodynamical quantity of two-dimensinal classical spin system efficiently.

For tensor contraction, ITensor(http://itensor.org/index.html) is called.


In this sorce code, we calculate for Ising model, but you can use it for another models by rewriting it just a little.
